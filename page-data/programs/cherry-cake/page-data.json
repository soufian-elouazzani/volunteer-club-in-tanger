If you are good at writing fast, detailed, and meaningful papers then you will be good at writing specifications for the language. If you are good at programming in C or C++, or have a general knowledge of programming language development, then CLI development is probably for you. If neither of these areas seem to fit, don't worryâ€“ there is no-doubt a job for you. To join, simply email Alden Grover, the head of the Cherry Cake Development Group and ask how you can help.","since":"2022-12-18","index":2}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
